###Additional notes:
Assignments are posted on-line - and do not take up classroom time
there is a visual presentation that goes with the lectures - do as much drawing and typing before hand as possible (avoid writing on board under pain of death)
All lectures are recorded, using camera from back, audio device up front, the visual slides, and whatever was written on the tablet
The class outline will be posted to the wiki, so that other teachers/administrators/parents can observe what is going on in the classroom
there should be 5 classes a week, with the last one for students to ask questions and work on their assignments, explore other topics similar to the class, or simply talk about life.

##Assignments
Assignments are all given at the beginning of the term (1 large assignment per month), with assignments each week building toward the large assingment
There is no due date for any of the assignments, only recommendations
1 week delay for handing the assignment on or before the time, 2 weeks delay for all late assignments
Students can resubmit work an unlimited amount of times, until the end of the semester

##Assessment
All assessment comes from the assignments, no tests will be given
Assignments are built upon each other, so if the students can do the final assignment, they will have proved their ability to pass the class.
Plagiarism is frowned upon, but students caught cheating will then be educated to reference their work. If a student attempts to blatently plagiarize twice, they will simply receive a zero for that assignment.
