#Markdown

I use markdown as the format for all text documents, and if you so wish to view them in their intended format, you will need a markdown previewer. There are many to go around, and a simple google search for the platform of your choice should yeild many options.

Otherwise, all files can be opened as pure text, requireing no additional software

#Contributing

If you wish to work with me on this, you will first need to understand how Git works 
<http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1>

If the command line scares you, then you can download a GUI <http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis>

You will need to create an account with Github to work on it. Please fork the project, and we can collaborate from there on things to include.
