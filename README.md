Building Cloud Communities

Nebulae Communitas (NebCom) is an organization dedicated to building strong ties between the local church, schools, and homes.

In essence, the focus is one the development of children in their community. I believe that children need 4 components to successfully grow up. They need to be fed spiritually, mentally, and physically. However, traditionally we have separated all of those aspects, keeping schools, homes, and church's often separate. There is not a lot of dialogue that goes on with an autonomous school, to an autonomous church.

Nebulae Communitas is latin for "cloud community". We seek to build communities, connecting people with knowledge and God.

The grand Idea is to use the analogy of the Galaxy. We are all part of the metaphoric galaxy. At our centre exists God, â€˜For in him we live and move and have our being." (Acts 18:28). The various entities that exist is knowledge/wisdom and People. It is in these 2 spheres, interacting with the centre, that all social life is composed. The word Nebulae is composed, because it is nebulae's that other planetary entities come into being. We are seeking to create these communities.

An important part of this analogy is to remember that all solar systems must orbit a Sun, and in our case, must orbit The Son. While Black Holes may provide the same functionality, they do not provide the light needed. Communities not centred on Christ will not be able to sustain life. I recognize that each has a different relationship with God, but that does not mean that God has changed, His Son still remains Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit continues to work in each of us.

This is essentially a brain child of David Guenther, third culture kid and dreamer.
