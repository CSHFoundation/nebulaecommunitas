#Constitution

##Purpose:
The School Community exists to educate students intellectually. To educate students well mentally requires spiritual education, emotional education, and physical education. Planet School will serve as the primary component of a students intellectual education, while allowing various other entities to contribute to a child's full development.

Planet School purpose is the transfer of knowledge centred around God, creating students who are physically fit, mentally sound, and spiritually alive.

##Organization:
###Teachers:
Teachers have a relationship with a specific knowledge; their role is to help foster a relationship between the student and this knowledge. To accomplish this, teachers must have a relationship with the students. Teachers are administrators, in the sense that collectively they work together to keep the school running well. The head teacher, considered "First Among Equals" makes sure the operation of the school is smooth.
###Students:
Students goal is to build a relationship with knowledge. The most effective way for students to do this is to build a relationship with a teacher. Other forms include learning from a teacher without relationship, and investigating the knowledge without a teacher, but neither of these two systems are as effective as the first. As students gain knowledge, they are then capable of imparting that knowledge to other students.

### Individual learning areas:
These areas are designed so that the student can learn on their own. Teachers also learn in individual learning areas. They are structured to be allow individuals to work at their own desks, and customize their desks to suite their needs. While not all students are able to learn at an individual learning area, this is designed to be profitable for the students that do learn in such places.
### Group learning areas:
This areas are designed to allow collaboration and teamwork. It will be structured much like the individual learning area, but will provide more opportunities for collaboration on projects. Lectures by a teacher could also happen in this area.
### Practice Learning Areas:
These rooms are designed to put into practice the theory covered in ILA's and GLA's. This could range from botany to roller coaster design. The equipment needed to practice different skills will be present in this room. If one is seeking to be a carpenter, a PLA will have tools to practice woodworking.
### Relaxation Areas:
RA's will be places were students can relax from what they are working on, get a fresh breath, and then go back and learn some more. A mind sharpened by breaks, works harder and faster, and more efficently

##Integration:

###Church:
Students should be provided with spiritual instruction, however, it should be the role of those with the spiritual gift of teaching to teach those students. The local church should connect with the school and provide teachers to lecture at the school. This also provides a framework for student to participate in their local church.
###Home:
The inability of students to pay attention in class is not the teacher's fault, though they may have some responsibility as well. Students who come from good homes are more likely to participate well in school. A students performance in school can be linked back to their relationship at home. As such, the School must work alongside parents in the emotional development of a child. If a parent has no desire to raise their children up in the instruction of the Lord, this becomes a spiritual problem, and should be addressed through the local Church. If a parent does not belong to the local church, after school programs providing temporary homes with love and support could be implemented for children whose parents no longer care.
###Business:
Students need hand on experiences, and having a good relationship with the local business in the area can provide the internships and hands on knowledge needed for students who will then join the workplace. Understanding what the local businesses are looking for in students can help provide some perspective (not curriculum!) on how the school should be instructing their students.


##Relaxation

Relaxation is an integral part of any one school day. Unfortunately, it is not emphasized near enough for students to adequately understand it. We assume that students know how to relax on their own, but that is not always the case. Students know how to not work, but that is not the same as relaxation. Relaxation often is accompanied by recreation. Personally, I feel more invigorated after capturing an image, then playing a video game. Students will learn more efficiently when they have had time to relax during the school day. As we approach kids who are more and more having trouble sitting still, this would be a wise practice to continue.

This Satellite has the focus on allowing students to relax during the school day in intermediate steps, so that they feel ready to continue to learn. Learning is tough, and the more brain power, the better.

##Community

Community is incredibly important for learning. Not only does it provide a safe environment where students do not feel threatened, but it provides the very framework for students to learn. A strong community creates a strong culture, and a strong culture in turn seeps into the minds of everyone present. It is through community that one often feels empowered.

One of the traditional problems of school is the lack of community building. Students across grades often do not have access to each other, and thus the gap is continued. What made my Bible school experience so great was not the classroom time, but the community that I built there. Community transforms individuals into community thinkers, and if we want students to grow to have a heart to love others, we had best model that inside the school first.
##Learning

Learning is the backbone of the school system, and that is why it must be pursued with excellence. There is no room for bad teacher, because bad teacher translates into bad learning. Students must learn with efficiency and purpose. Everything the teacher does in the classroom must have purpose.

##Communication

Communication is an integral part of entering the work force. Students who do not know how to articulate what they have learned are not an asset to society. Students must be able to clearly get their point across. This is especially important for understanding other cultures.

##Teaching

How do we separate learning from teaching. Easy: learning is what the student does, teaching is what the teacher does. While the student has their own responsibility to learn, teachers can aid and guide this process. Good teaching not only imparts information, but encourages students to learn for themselves. Perhaps the best teachers are those that have found the way to do the least amount of work possible, because they support their students to pursue their own passions. Good teaching is not easy to do, but neither is it impossible. It requires being true to yourself, and a passion to teach.

##Technology

Teaching kids how to use technology is an important part of their existence in today's world
