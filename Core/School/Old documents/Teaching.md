20 Minute Lessons (S.3.1)

Students struggle to stay awake and motivated throughout a 60 minute lecture. Perhaps one of the struggles is that teachers don't know how to fill the time, and so rabbit trails are a norm of the class. Reducing the class time motivated students to stay on task, and teachers to prepare shorter lessons that get the point across faster. As we want students to continue to learn at an absurd speed, shorter lessons allow more lessons to go on throughout the day. Every lesson will have a learning point, and that will be assessed by digital quizs, at the end of each day.

Some may object, and say that students cannot learn at that speed. A case to consider is that of the Home School students. They advance at a rate that puts the public school system to shame, and they don't even have "qualified" teachers. They work alone, and work much faster.

Collaboration (S.3.2)

As the classes will be much shorter, this gives a considerable amount of extra time in the day for students to do other things. Having this modular approach guarantees that students who need help mastering a subject can get it, while students who are seeking more challenges can also get them. One such aspect of both challenges and mastering is in the approach of collaboration at the end of the school day. Students are given a short task to do that combines elements of what they learned that day. They must work as a group to accomplish the goal. As the time is limited, and they must submit their project before they leave school, this brings motivation to the students to get the job done.

Teachers must be conscious of the time limitations and assign appropriate tasks

3x3 Creativity Chart (S.3.3)

Students must be creative. It is a core part of the curriculum. When trying to think up something creative for a project/lesson/speech, students will provide a 3x3 table in which they must fill each box with something different from the others. After getting feedback from a fellow student/teacher, the student then makes another 3x3 chart, putting into place the ideas/criticisms that were discussed.

Class Electives (S.3.4)
Foundation: Individual Learning

While we do have a certain curriculum we must get all students through, perhaps we can add more flexibility to the program. Allowing students to pick electives from an early age says to them, "we want your learning to be your own." We would rather have students take classes that they want to take, then classes that they hate. In a small school this is hard, but this is exactly where individual learning jumps and leaps. For the learning is student driven, with the teacher guiding. We need teachers to teach the basic core concepts, but there is a lot of extra curriculum that cannot be covered. Students should have an opportunity to pursue subjects that they wish to take. Some may say that students in grade 6 are not old enough to pursue their own interests, they should have others keep doors open for them. Perhaps, but lets do that then collaboratively, by guiding them, and not telling them.

Games (S.3.5)
Foundation: On Site Learning

Students involvement spikes when a game is present. If a game can be incorporated into part of the learning process, this would be beneficial for the students. Examples include games to test their knowledge (instead of traditional exams), Calorie counting game to motivate students to work out. Making things into a game motivates students to try harder. However, care must be given that students understand that winning is not everything, and sometimes it may be in their best interest to lose. Either way, games helps the facilitation of on-site learning.

Testing and Grading (S.3.6)
Foundation: Good Fit Learning,

What is the purpose of grades? It should be a form of encouragement to the students. Often that is not what the current grading system accomplishes. I like to get good grades, but I will not break my back getting an A. Why? Because I know I can pass on a B, or even a C, and still graduate. The current system does not help matters, when students are systematically not given full marks on papers, so that the student understands they could do better. Grades should serve as motivation for students to do better. Everything the student could have done to achieve full marks should be present on an assignment turned back. So that if the student corrected everything the teacher asked, the paper would stand to get full marks. However, such a shift in the paradigm of thinking requires that we look at papers not in light of all papers in the school, or even in the country, but focusing on the requirements of the assignment. If the student has achieved the requirements, full marks must be given. We must observe grading not in light of anyone else besides the student. Grading and testing is for the benefit of the student, and should remain that way. Such a conclusion leads to the idea that students individually should be marked differently, and graded differently. One may raise the objection that this is not fair, but the question in return is such: what is the focus of education? Is it to educate students, or prove who knows the most in math? Students will be graded instead on their effort, and participation in the assignments. Removing grades from the mix also helps, for students at the same age will need to be in different brackets of class. This ensures that those with a similar skill level are being graded the same.

This is not to suppose that we desire students to learn nothing while they are at school. On the contrary, it is quite the opposite. When an car starts up, it would be foolish to suppose that it could first go into 5th gear. No, a car must first start in the lower gears, and then make its way up to the higher. Likewise, testing and grading that starts at the students level, and builds them up to the higher levels, will produce a student more educated than those that think students should be graded hard off right off the bat.

It encourages students to get full marks, for they realize it can be done. This promotes excellence and passion in the students. When full marks have not been given, the student clearly sees why, and the next time they know how to fix it. When most of their peers are getting high grades, it will produce an atmosphere of excellence, so that even the most lazy student will try hard, so that they do not feel left out.

In order for other agencies and organizations to know the competencies of each student, upon graduation each student will be evaluated on the skills they have mastered, and their commitment to working hard. This individualized report will not only include numbers, but letters, and words, and even sentences, indicating why or why not this student will be a good fit for a university or a job.

Also to consider is having external standardized testing to ensure competencies in certain subject matter. Perhaps looking into the IB program for testing?

Job Preparedness (S.3.7)
Foundation: Purpose

The education system has so degraded that if someone wants a job, other than manual labour, getting a grade 12 education is simply not enough. And the question must be asked, why not? Why is spending 12 years of your life in a system not enough to prepare you for whatever you seek to do? 12 years is surely enough. The system I propose would be more along the lines of 15 years, (5 or so years before age ten), and then a 10 year program after that. I believe that In that time I can develop a student who will not only be able to do any job with excellence, but also have the the education equivalent to a four year degree in college. And all this by the age of 20. This is no easy task, but the focus remains such: to prepare students for the work force.

This means active communication with businesses, to determine the type of student they would like to hire. Contacting large organizations such as Google or Loblaw will help the schools make a more accurate assessment about what needs to be taught. While schools should never be driven by money, getting jobs remains a key factor in education. It may even be arguably the most important aspect of mandatory education. In previous days men could be blacksmiths, fishermen, or traders without a significant amount of base knowledge. Everything could be learned on the job. However, we are in the midst of an academic inflation.

In order to combat this, we must educate students that although they may not hold a degree that cost them 50,000 dollars, they have all of the skills needed. Hopefully employers will note that although these students may not hold a degree like others, they will work harder and smarter than any other employee. It will be a struggle in the beginning, as some may not recognize this new type of degree, but hopefully with time it will become the norm.

Levels (S.3.8)
Foundation: Good Fit Learning, Learning Community

The current procedure of putting students into grades has indeed fallen by the wayside. Originally manufactured to provide a sense of unity to a program, the unity we sought for is now becoming our undoing. Students are passed from grade to grade, simply because teachers do not desire to teach the students another year. Grades have been reduced to not skill level, but age. With content becoming increasingly more complex, and new areas of information coming into existence, we can no longer operate under the same premise that we once did. Students must be taught according to experience level, and not according to age. This current system however, groups students according to age; students outside of a normal age range do not feel they fit in.

Students do need a sense of community, and those of a similar age provide that community. But students also need to learn with those of a similar skill level as themselves, as otherwise it would hinder their educational growth. Providing levels brings this picture into focus.

Levels must be passed before the student can proceed (much like a level in a game). However, this does not affect the relationship they have with their peers. They will pass levels outside of their home community. As such, a large portion of their learning will not happen in a home classroom environment. Students will go to their learning levels, and complete their learning there.

Such a system allows students who have trouble with concepts to complete their understanding, before moving on. Such a system also allows students who feel the need to learn more to do so as well: the only limit is their own learning.

There is a possibility of students being left behind, and that is precisely why a safe-guard must be established. Students must all pass the exit exam. If the student is falling behind, more energy must be given to bring them to a place where at the end of their time at school, they will be able to pass the exam. As school will operate for 10 years, from age 10 to age 20, these extra two years provide an extra degree of flexibility for students struggling to pass the exit exam.

While it may be tempting to make 10 levels, one for each year, such a process is not the intention of levels. Levels are meant to be incremental changes to different things the student is learning. For example, there could be 200 levels in the "Math" program. While such a method works really well for "Math", it becomes less obvious in a subject such as Communication. This does not mean that English can have incremental learning. English is all about incrementally learning the language, it just happens that the way it looks is different then "Math". A level 56 in English might be simply reading a certain book, and doing a paper on it, with more expectations on how the paper is to be formatted. A level 65 in World would possibly be examining WWII. Levels are meant to be complete units. They are designed to push gifted students through the program as fast as they student can, and to provide more time for students who struggle to complete their learning, without being rushed into the next one.

Levels in a particular subject will have its own name, as the focus is not on learning math 211, but rather knowing a particular concept. The idea of a level is to allow students to learn a particular skill. This ensures a level maintains focus, instead of being a generalized class. This brings focus to each lesson delivered by teachers. (But do we want that kind of focus, perhaps the rambling teacher is a source of learning for students)

A rambling teacher, if he wishes to include stories from his life, can still do so within the confines of the the levels approach, however, it means he has less time to do so, which may make what he or she says that more important.

There are mandatory levels for each student to complete, as everything else rests upon these, but after that, levels can be chosen by the student in their interest.

At the completion of their time at Planet School, a transcript will be provided detailing what level they completed for each core subject, and what level they achieved on any electives.

In order to boost student retention and test taking, students will take a comprehensive test every 10 levels or so. This has yet to be determined.

Additionally, distance students can still complete the levels, even after they graduate, for higher levels of education. This provides an opportunity to improve one's transcript even after you have graduated from school. For older students in the 40+ range, learning can still be an option.

Home school parents will find this refreshing, because although their student is doing much of their work at home, they still have the benefit of teacher feedback. While Mom and Dad are the encourager, often the parents struggle to help their students in higher levels of education. Levels in one solution to this dilemma.

Passionate Teachers (S.5.1)
Foundation: Discipleship

I teach best when I am passionate about something. Not because one necessary speaks better or have a clearer voice, but because the passion they have overflows to their students. Students are far more likely to become passionate about something if they know their teacher is also passionate about it. Passion is like a fire, and spreads. In light of this, teachers must be passionate about what they teach. Hiring teachers who are passionate about their subject areas is a must. Principals must make an effort to keep the teachers passionate about what they do. Teachers who are passionate naturally spend more of their free time learning more. Passionate teachers are in professional development the entire day.

Hard Homework (S.5.2)
Foundation: Personalized learning

I have found from personal experience that the classes I learn the most from are those that 1) I have a brilliant teacher, or 2) the homework is harder than I can currently do, and so I am forced to research outside of class time solutions to help me succeed. Putting hard homework questions provides a constant stream of learning. Students who do not find the homework challenging stop learning. However, in order for this to be in place, a couple of things need to be recognized. First, students need to understand that their learning rests in their own hands, and it is their responsibility to learn. Second, students need to know how to look for help, and we need to teach them how to do so. Third, homework must differ from student to student. We do not want to give impossible homework, as some students would find, but hard. Each student must be given appropriate homework to match their current learning level.

Hard Teaching (S.5.3)

As children progress, they begin to learn how to speak by listening to words they do not understand, and then incorporate those words into their vocabulary. The same works in children as they continue to grow up. They reach up to grasp the level of their educator. If their educator teaches below their level, they will have nothing to work towards. Teaching and talking above their current skill level gives students a challenge. Not too much they cannot understand, but enough that it pushes them to understand more. Having teachers consistently speak using a diverse vocabulary ensures that the students will also learn to speak in such a way. In the case of infants, they learn to build a language using almost nothing, however, no matter how much you practice your physics vocabulary, they probably will not be able to understand you. This is because the abstract reasoning needed to understand those words is not present yet. While we can teach students new vocabulary, care must be given that they will be able to comprehend what the words mean. Some students may not be at a point to grasp what you are saying, and will end up concluding they are idiots. This is not the kind of teaching Planet School hopes to achieve.

Parent Involvement (S.5.4)
Foundation: Family, Moral Development

There are a lot of things that parents need to teach their kids. Sex education is one of these areas. However, the broader question of parent involvement in schools is much larger than teaching one subject area. When we desire to impart morals, the best teacher in the room is not the one with the educational degree, or even the room itself, but the parents in the room. Now this assumes a fair amount, that these parents have a good home life, and are involved with their church. However, parents can do a much better job of imparting a lot of truths.

One way to accomplish this is to include the parents as much as possible in the lower ages. Parents should be included in part of the school day. This becomes increasing harder when students start to take classes that the parents have trouble with.

Another possibility is to provide education only for ages 10-20. We would require parents to home school their kids until they were 10 years old. I personally believe the foundation that students would get from their parents is better than any current K-4 program. Kids need their parents in order to grow into competent adults. Often the later issues in life are related to the lack of parental involvement when the child was young. Planet School in no way desires to encourage such neglectful parenting, by providing a free day care so that the parents can work. However, most parents may feel they are not skilled to home school their children, or lack the necessary motivation. Some parents also may have money concerns, and cannot afford to have one parent home for that length of time. While we feel that is a tragedy, we are willing to work with the demands of parents, understanding that they do wish the best for their children.

Providing a partnership, where students learn some things at school, but are also expected to learn some things at home, could be a viable solution. Half days for students up to age 9, and then age 10-20 they would have full day. Parents should be hired as the teachers for the lower ages. This gives them an opportunity to make some money, and yet also interact with their children, and others.

For later grades, parents should still be brought in to do certain modules, and provide help for discipline. When in doubt, the answer is yes, bring the parent in. Including the parents in the entire life of the school will create more well-rounded individuals.

Exit Exam (S.5.5)

At the end of a students time at school, the question arises: what does the student know? While curriculum and tests provide some markers to establish what the student knows, Planet School is much more about individual pockets of information. Students should be able to synthesize what they have learned over the course of their time at the school, and that is why an exit exam is in order.

This differs considerable from something like IB exam, or a standardized exam from the ministry of education. This exam is not only a test per say, but it is also a way to measure other things the student may have learned, from their sense of independent learning, to their motivation to finish assignments. The current level of standardization does not fully reflect a students ability to thrive in the workplace. The exit exam fixes this problem, by providing a way to evaluate students on a deeper level.

Students will be tested in all subject areas studied, and must provide an understanding of the skills they should have mastered.

Students will be tested in the following areas:
Logic (Math, Theology, Problem Solving)
Communication (reading, writing, grammar, and public speaking)
Wisdom (History, Ethics)
World (Science, Social Studies, Technology)
Electives (depending on what they pursued outside of the normal curriculum)

Each student will be assessed individually, through a combination of a visual, auditory, kinematic test. Depending on the different learning styles of the students will determine the way they are tested. This ensures the best method for testing what they do know. We are not interested in their skills at writing tests, but rather the amount of information they have gathered.

In order to guarantee a level of excellence, students will take a standardized test as well (such as the SAT). Once Planet School has established a good reputation, the SAT could be dropped. This is no way implies that the level of excellence will decrease. Students must meet the standards set previously. It is just that we believe the best method for evaluation does not lie in written exams, but in individualized exams.

This is a pass/fail component. If the the student does not show mastery of their subject areas, more time will need to be spent in school. We will not allow students to leave who do not understand the material.

Evaluation Assessment (S.5.6)
Foundation: Purpose

What is the purpose of testing? If our answer begins to fall in the category of aids to the teacher, we have severely missed the point. The purpose of Planet School is the develop the mind, and as such, all testing must be an extension of that purpose. Testing should not be seen as the end, but rather as the beginning of the end. It is the process in which the student expresses what they have learned. This process should aid the student, so that they can can improve on their mistakes. Every mistake a student makes should be corrected, not only by the marker, but also by the student. Students should have multiple times they can submit homework, correcting their mistakes at each try.

Caution must be taken, as this system can be easily abused. Students can begin by not learning, and simply rely on the teacher to provide the right answer. Right answers must not be given before a student has fully attempted a solution. Help and hints can be given, but ultimately the student needs to solve the problem on their own.

This applies to everything from papers, to math questions. If a student stops trying to correct their work, they will rest with their final grade. We are not about giving out free marks. If a student does not try hard the first time, they will stick with that grade, even though they will be required to submit corrections. This is a per case study, and no strict rule should be followed. On one hand we want students to learn as much as they can, but on the other hand, we have no desire to see students stop respecting the deadline.

If a student receives a paper of any kind back, if they were to follow all of the advice given on the paper, and resubmit it, full marks are expected. Teachers must give full marks if a student meets the expectations, which must be clearly stated before the assignment is begun.

While the assessment should be clear, not every teacher needs to provide the same rubric. Some teachers emphasis some areas more then others, and this is be encouraged. Teachers teach best when they are passionate about what they teach. Not to neglect certain portions of the curriculum, but students will learn more from a teacher who assesses based on their passion of technology, more then a teacher who doesn't. It would be better to be assessed in a certain area by a teacher who is passionate about what they do.

Bored/Dazed Student Policy (S.5.7)
Foundation: engagement

You've all been through this before. The teacher is drowning on and on about something you already understand, and you feel like just taking a nap. Or perhaps the other way, the teacher is talking about some form of new branch of physics, and they lost you when they said "atomic". Either way, learning has ceased to happen, and this is a problem for a school dedicated to the development of the mind. The mind is not developed when learning stops.

As such, a no bored/dazed student teaching policy would be in order. When students get bored or dazed, something must be done. While this should not interrupt a class (some topics may appear to be more dull then others), consistent tuning out on the students part is not beneficial, and must be discussed with the principle if a solution cannot be found found on the teachers part.

Active observation from other teachers will help the teaching professionals to keep clear feedback about the attention of the students. Teachers must make active efforts to keep students from tuning out.

As Planet School is a hybrid of individual learning and group learning, many of the current problems will be eliminated, but care must be given that during the group instruction times, students do not tune out.

Great Teachers (S.5.8)

As teachers, we often feel the need to be the one speaking, the one in charge, the one with all the knowledge. Perhaps such a model worked when information was significantly harder to come by. In our day and age however, there is no small supply of great literature out there, easily accessible for all.

We want the best students, so we need to make sure that the best teachers are teaching our students. The best teacher is probably not currently in the classroom. I would rather that students learn logic from Aristotle, Relativity from Einstein, or Calculus from Newton. (I assume they understand their subject best, as they discovered much of what we have today) As more then naught the best teachers are no longer living, what we have left is their work. When teaching a lesson a teacher has two courses of action. 1: teach directly from the master teacher, or 2: let the students read from the master teacher.

Home-schooling Curriculum has produced some of the best students because they understand this concept. They connect their students to brilliant minds, and the parents provide the encouragement and diligence for the student to continue. This is an effective model. Home schooled kids are usually smarter, more creative, and harder working. The one thing they lack is understanding community, as this is the area in which they lack. Public school, on the other hand, thrives at community, often to the point of detriment for the education of the student.

Planet school seeks a happy medium, "connecting students to great minds in a community of learners". Students will learn from the some of the best in their field, and yet, retain their community of learners, where they can bounce ideas off of each other and learn to work together.

Care must be given when choosing textbooks and lectures, so that the best in the field is chosen. Care must be given to constantly evaluate if the textbook is leading in the field.

This will come into focus as levels are developed, and grades are taken away. As teachers cannot be fluent in all the topics we wish to cover with levels, students will need to be learning from other sources. If we want to cover a course of publishing your own book, it is much simpler to provide a book about it, then to bring a guy into for a semester to teach it.

So what is the purpose of the educators present physically at the school. They are facilitators, but even more then that, they are thinkers, encourages, dreamers, debtors. They will teach the students to think about what they are reading, and apply it to their own lives. They will teach courses that they are sufficient at, especially in levels near the beginning, where a majority of students will still be together.

However, as students will be home-schooled until age 10, there should be no problem with students understanding how to learn on their own. It is then that the process of learning in a more formal setting will commence.

The point remains, great teachers inspire students, and Planet School will make the effort to make sure that the best teachers are teaching our students.

Teaching Profiles (S.5.9)
Foundation: Best Fit

Teachers teach best when they are teaching according to their strengths. Students learn best from excellent teachers. Teachers trying to bend over backwards to accommodate students sacrifice good instruction. As a students brain can be moulded, having a clear teaching approach will help students stay with you in class.
