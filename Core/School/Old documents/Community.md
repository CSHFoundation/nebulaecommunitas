Community is incredibly important for learning. Not only does it provide a safe environment where students do not feel threatened, but it provides the very framework for students to learn. A strong community creates a strong culture, and a strong culture in turn seeps into the minds of everyone present. It is through community that one often feels empowered.

One of the traditional problems of school is the lack of community building. Students across grades often do not have access to each other, and thus the gap is continued. What made my Bible school experience so great was not the classroom time, but the community that I built there. Community transforms individuals into community thinkers, and if we want students to grow to have a heart to love others, we had best model that inside the school first.

Fun Events (S.2.1)

Example: Ball pit!
We loved them as kids, and the bright colours are invigorating for adults.
Check out this video:

In this video random people talk to each other by both jumping into a ball pit. The conversation is kept by answering questions on plastic balls.

This serves an important point:
Students will connect, if given the environment to. Schools must be structured in such a way to allow this community to take place. Putting questions on the spheres may induce talking. but once again, if community is not given the platform to, there is little hope it will naturally occur. Teachers must model this behaviour.

A ball pit in the school may be a way for community to be built

Abortion Policy (S.2.2)

Should a student become pregnant while at school, it is the duty of the staff to save this child, if the thought of abortion has entered the mind of the individual. If the student cannot be motivated to keep the child, attempts will be made to adopt this baby. If the child refuses to let their child be adopted, and pushed forward to abort the baby, expulsion will be discussed with the school board.

In collaboration with Planet Church, and Planet Home, the child will find a home. Let's hope there are people willing to save a life, for its life rests with the community

10-10(S.2.3)

Often times we run across people who believe things differently than us. In this school we all believe in Christ, and should without a doubt hold Him to be our centre, sometimes we have different ideas about how to do things.

The 10-10 approach is designed to help students understand each other, and provide opportunities for logic and truth to be explored. 2 students who wish to approach a topic they disagree with will go about it like this: Each student will make a list of 10 things they believe about the topic and give their reasons why, after this the other student will give their own list of 10 things they believe and why. Make sure the "why" is emphasized. Merely spouting off what one thinks to be true without backing their ideas is a disgrace to the pursuit of truth.

Speed Friendship(S.2.4)

Speed Friendship is based off of the idea of speed dating, in which a large group of people get to know each other rather quickly. It uses a rotational system, so that after 5 minutes the parties switch off to another table and begin the conversation again. Great way to start the year, so that students get to know each other.

Other Schools (S.2.5)

While a lot of emphasis is in house, and important part of learning is also understanding the network of schools. Doing events with other schools, and participating in programs like forensics, sports, and drama with other schools helps maintain a healthy dialogue with others. Making this a priority in the school will help the school from becoming focused on itself. New ideas often come from outside the group; maintaining this strong relationship is must.
