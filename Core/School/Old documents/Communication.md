Speed Geeking (S.4.1)

Speed geeking is similar to speed dating, expect the purpose is not to get to know people, but rather to present a topic or concept.

The approach is such: Students give a 5 minute presentation multiple times to people as they rotate around the room. A central bell ensures that everyone moves at the same time.

Students can use this approach to showcase their work for days in which Planet School brings Planet Home in. Parents/Guardians can view the work of the students. This is also a form of building community

Pecha Kucha (S.4.2)

Pecha Kucha is a tecnique for giving presentation. It works like this. 20 slides, 20 seconds each slide. The slides advance whether or not the student is ready. Students are forced to come up with short slides, and practice delivering pre-planned message. As rambling (ums/likes) are never professional, this helps students to eliminate those from their behaviour.

4N6 (S.4.3)

The Nation Forensics league is a great extra curricular activity for students to practice their debate, speech, poetry, etc. Making this mandatory for each student to try at least once will help students come out of their shell. Creating a culture in which everyone participates helps those who are shy to realize they are not alone.
