Satellite Relaxation:

Relaxation is an integral part of any one school day. Unfortunately, it is not emphasized near enough for students to adequately understand it. We assume that students know how to relax on their own, but that is not always the case. Students know how to not work, but that is not the same as relaxation. Relaxation often is accompanied by recreation. Personally, I feel more invigorated after capturing an image, than playing a video game. Students will learn more efficiently when they have had time to relax during the school day. As we approach kids who are more and more having trouble sitting still, this would be a wise practice to continue.

This Satellite has the focus on allowing students to relax during the school day in intermediate steps, so that they feel ready to continue to learn. Learning is tough, and the more brain power, the better.


Bird Therapy (S.1.1)
Foundation: Relaxation (see above), Natural World

Animals have a profound affect on the psychology of humans. See: Puppy Room. As such, it is a small wonder we have not included more animals in the classroom. Students are stressed, and do need relaxation zones where the sole purpose is the allow for relaxation.

I propose a Bird room, where multiple Parakeets live. This will be an indoor facility. The room will be about 10 Square meters, in which will be natural lighting, running water, and multiple parakeets.

The first door entering will be a humidity door, and the second will be beads, to keep the parakeets in. This way the moisture is not escaping, and yet, students feel they can enter the home of the parakeets in a none intrusive manner.

The parakeets will be needed to be trained, in order to desire communication with students. When a new parakeet is purchased, it will be the role of a student, designated by a teacher, who will then have the task of teaching this bird to be sociable. If the task proves too difficult, perhaps a teacher should do all the work.

To ensure the safety of the birds, grades K-5 will need the supervision of an elder grade. Only students approved by home room teachers can supervise younger grades.

Certain non-toxic plants for parakeets can also be grown in there, and in fact, is encouraged.
