This document outlines many procedures for staying safe online, students should be familiar will all of them. The document is long (83 pages) and provides much in the interest of staying safe online

Typing (S.6.2)

Typing is the pen of the internet, and students must be capable and fast typers. To increase their speed, students will learn Colemak, instead of qwerty, which will significantly increase their typing speed. No hunting and pecking for these students!

Standards (S.6.3)

Little use has Planet School for proprietary lock-ins. The technology and organization of Planet School must be standardized. To clarify: Planet School wants to have a wiki for every school. However, using a particular wiki would go against standardization. We want the concept of a wiki, not a specific vendor to full fill that need. While all schools should have a wiki, each school's wiki will look different, because it is up the school what software they use. The idea remains the same, but the way it is executed differs. So it is with standardization.

Smart boards may not be allowed in the classroom, for the reason that they have a proprietary lock on it. It has not become a standard yet, and remains a business venture. If the idea of having an interactive whiteboard gains mainstream use, and multiple companies are offering a similar product, and if those products are compatible with each other, then it has become a standard. Until that point, it is dangerous to commit time and resources to a project that requires die-hard followers. Apple computers are not part of Planet School's infrastructure (students are still welcome to buy the laptops), as Apple requires lock-ins that destroy the open nature of Planet School

School Wiki (S.6.4)
Foundation: Purpose driven education

The most effective school is one in which all members are in sync with each other. They know what is going on in other classes, and they can plan accordingly. To promote such collaboration on a much greater scale, each school should have their own wiki, in which teachers post their lesson plans. This provides the communication needed for multiple educators to understand what is going on in any given day for any given student.

Additionally, this is a great asset to future teachers, as a lot of their lesson planning will be already written, and they can then customize to their own needs. Substitute teachers will have little problem fitting into such a schedule, when they know where everything is going. Likewise parents can know what is being taught on any given day, and can ask questions appropriately at home. Knowing what is taught can also guide parents to get more involved in the classroom, as they may offer to help teach a certain lesson.

The most pressing con I can think of is such: teachers will no longer be able to wing their lesson plans, and must have at least a rough idea on paper about what is happening each lesson. Although, I don't think a purpose-driven school can ever tolerate teachers who wing their lesson plans. This is not to suggest teachers must have every word they are going to speak on paper, but it does indicate that teachers need to have a clear purpose for every lesson.

Ideally, this wiki should be a sub-domain of the schools website. ie: wiki.yourschoolnamehere.ca
