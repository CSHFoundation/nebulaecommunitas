## Purpose

The church is a community for a group of believers who live in close proximity to each other. The ultimate goal of the church is provide the framework necessary for meaningful discipleship to take place. The church collectively seeks to grow individuals spiritually though a connection to God (the Word being a key component), provide emotional/mental help to those who need it, and physical help to those who need it as well.

The Church is the representation of Christ on earth. While the church has often gone astray from Her Lord and Maker, she nevertheless remains loved by God. We hold a commitment to the church, but it is even more then that, for we are the church. We hold a commitment to ourselves to be in community with other believers. We believe in being in community with other believers, and we make it our focus to continue that.

In all of our efforts for spiritual growth, the church must be involved. We cannot raise up students who love God, if they have no learned to love God, if they have not learned to love the Bride of Christ. We cannot raise up good kids in our homes, if they have not learned to love God with all of their heart. We may discipline them, but if they do not have Christ, we have given them nothing.

Everything hangs on the church, for it is responsible for keeping the faith.

The Rock of the Church is her husband, Christ Jesus our Lord. As such,

* From Him:
	+ What He says [Word of God] (listening to and responding to what God has said)
	+ What He has given us
		- [Fruit of the Spirit] (love, joy, peace, etc, lived out in each member)
		- [Gifts of the Spirit] (teaching, evangelism, encouragement...etc)
- His Son, and through Him, right relationship with God
* Our Response
	+ Our remembrance of Him [communion] (eating together to commemorate what Christ has done)
	+ Our public declaration of our allegiance to Him [Baptism]
	+ Our Relationship to Him
		- Our Obedience to Him
		- Our Worship of Him
		- Our Prayer to Him

If any of these aspects are ignored, the church suffers


## Roles

### Apostle 
=======
### Apostle

Apostles serve to establish new churches, but going out and proclaiming the truth where no one has yet heard the Gospel. An Apostle views these new churches as new-born children, continuing to care for them until they reach a maturity in the faith.
### Prophets
Prophets serve to reveal the thoughts of God to the church. Their words must be tested by other prophets, as a safe-guard against heresy.
### Evangelists
Evangelists serve to bring the Gospel to people in the same location as their church. Once a person has committed their life to the Lord, the evangelist can provide the necessary connection to an church to help this new believer continue to grow as a Christian.
### Elders
Elders serve to guide and protect the people who belong to the church. As this is a role which has much influence over others, strict guidelines, as outlined in the NT, must be followed without compromise (1 Tim 3, Titus 1).
### Teachers
Teachers serve to accurately teach the Word of God.
### Deacons
Deacons serve to serve, helping the church practically so that others can focus on their ministries.

## Functions

### Meetings
The church meets together regularly to encourage each other. (Hebrew 10:25)
### Teaching
The Word of God is the life-blood of any church. There is perhaps a subtle heresy that has crawled into our midst, that preaching is enough for believers. Thus we structure the entire week around the Sunday morning service, in which people get their nourishment in the Word. This has created a multitude of problems, as preachers had to respond to the increasing demand of having both believers and non believers in their midst. Thus the dual service was launched. It was designed to handle both parties, those who were not yet believers, and the deeper students of the Word. Thus, it became increasingly harder for anyone to take this mantle, often with men committing their entire lives to just that, preaching. Now this is not to say that they did not succeed. Men who had the gift of preaching such as Spurgeon, Whitefield, and Graham have been given the gift of preaching. This means they can hold an audience and cause them to come to Christ. Thousands of people went away transformed, however, while this a function of the church, we must remember that this is not the church. The Church is the new community joined by those who have been saved by the the blood of Christ, and they need teaching. No longer do they need preaching, because preaching is for those outside. Teaching is for those inside the church.

>*Consider these verses: Acts 2:42, Mark 6:12, Matthew 4:17, 1 Tim 4:11, Ephesians 4:11*

As such, the structure of the Church must be reflected to pursue excellence in teaching. This means that active education is a key foundation for the life of the Church.

Hand in hand with teaching goes Biblical theology. If the Bible is not the source of meaning, then something else quickly takes it place. While we do desire to have effective teaching as part of the core of Planet Church, good teaching requires good material to be covered. Too often has the Word of God been dismissed, because of some new issue or some new discussion. Too easy is it for us to disregard what was said, because of the implications of that belief. Any other light to our path is a poor substitute for the light that burns brighter then day.
## Community
Without community there is no body of Christ. Only individuals who do not build each other up.
Ministries:
The church participates in various ministries, being equipped by the APEET; doing the work laid out before them. (Ephesians 2:10, 4:11-12, 1 Corinthians 12:27-31, 1 Peter 4:10)
Missions:
The church also sends out apostles to create new assemblies in other locations. Also giving help to other assemblies that may be struggling. (Romans 10:15, 1 Corinthians 16:1-4, John 17:20-23, Proverbs 27:10)

## Definitions

### Trinity
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are 3-in-one, yet each part is distinct.
### God:
The almighty Father
### Jesus:
Jesus is our only way to God, and we cannot on our own merit gain entrance to the King of Kings without first accepting Jesus as the Son of God, and making him Lord and Savior of our Life.
### Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit indwells every believer who confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord, and through the Spirit God grants different gifts to the members of his body, so that all might be built up.
### Bible
The Bible is the basis for truth, and anything added to it or taken away from it weakens the body of Christ.
### Sin
Man is inherently sinful and doomed to destruction. It is the grace of God that saves man. Without believing in Christ, we cannot be saved. If is not by our own righteousness that we can be saved. No amount of rules and regulations can make us right with God, for we are all sinners at heart. A true belief in Christ entails repentance and and change of heart.
### Church
The church is a group of believers who have been called out of the world to meet together.A church is defined by the following 4 characteristics: Believers who meet regularly together for the purpose of spiritual growth situated in a permanent location. The people of an church continue to be an church even when they are not formally meeting together. In all circumstances, it is ideal for believers living in the same general location to consider themselves once church
