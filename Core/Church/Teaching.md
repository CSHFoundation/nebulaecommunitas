#Plurality of Teachers
Foundation: 1 Corinthians 14:26-33, Ephesians 4:1-16, Ecclesiastes 4:13-16, Proverbs 24:6

It is important that more then one man teach in any given week. It is also important that one man not hold the same prominent teaching office, at the expense of others not being able to hold perform the same function. In more simple terms, I do't want one man to routinely teach at a gathering, assuming it to be his God-given position to do so. The church is a community, and community means it builds each other up.

It is foolish to suppose that there is only one teacher in your midst. God has given gifts to many, not just one. If there are those who God has gifted to teach, they should teach. Men who hold tightly to their own show, refusing to share the spotlight, will soon realize that the owner of the lights has move the lights, and they are left standing in the dark. It is God who directs the Church, His Bride, and He bestows gifts to men. If He has chosen to bestow gifts of teaching to those inside the church, should they not teach?

It is also a form of safekeeping. One man can abuse power, but with a multitude of advisor's, it is much harder to do so. Multiple teachers means that one man cannot twist the Scriptures, as others could come after him and speak otherwise. He no longer holds the power to direct the course of the Church, nor should he ever have had that power. If we are talking about elders/pastors, there should be a plurality of them as well.

#Iron Sharpens Iron
Foundation: 1 Corinthians 14:29, Proverbs 27:17, Proverbs 15:22, Ephesians 4:11, 

It is easy for an individual to find their way into obscure theology. This is partially because one point is emphasized over another, to the point that truth has been compromised. Lies are not the absence of truth, but rather the distortion of it. For an effective lie to work, there must be much truth in it. Such have been the lies of our generation.

In a corporate church setting, it is no different. An individual may not think they are pursuing a lie on their own, and that is why one needs a community of believers to keep themselves on track. When iron stops sharpening iron, the sword grows dull. When a leader in the church stops listening to the views and opinions of his fellow believers, the church grows dull. There must be a process of refining ideas by examining them, holding them up to scripture, and getting to the truth of the matter. Too often the pastor preaches a sermon, and there is no dialogue for whether he was right in all the points he made. Believe me, I've preached sermons, and I make mistakes. I am not inerrant, and am prone to slip up in my words. I can try to preach solid theology, but sometimes I mess up, and there must be a system in place to catch such people graciously and firmly.

There was a process in the early church that consisted of someone giving a prophecy, and then others examining it. While we are dealing primarily with teachers, perhaps we have come to a point in time which was not as clear cut as it was back then. Perhaps there was little opportunity to meddle with the theology of the New Testament, for it was more plain to them then it was to us?

#Multiple Meetings
Foundation: Acts 2:26, Hebrews 10:24-25

When multiple meetings become mandatory, their power is removed, for it becomes something entirely different from the Gospel, it becomes an obligation, which will quickly kill the desire for others to be part of your church. Mandatory meetings constitute bad religion.

That said, if a church should so desire to meet more then once a week, it would do great good for those present. For we are strong when we encourage each other, we are strong when we meet together, and we learn most not from a drink of water once a week, but drinks of water throughout the week as well. Now this becomes a bit of a problem, because people claim to be very busy, and it is hard to motivate someone to spend more of their time at church, a place often associated with very boring speakers and hard benches. However, if we could but convince people of the blessings of being at church, perhaps we could get more to come. Perhaps if people viewed church not as something they get from it, but something they put back, it would bring more purpose to their being there. The danger we find ourselves in is the TV-church. The people come, they sit back, they relax, someone plays music, someone talks, and they go home. Had they but a big enough screen, one could successfully attend without even being there!

And so people are not learning. They know the basic truths about Christianity, they know about God, and Christ, but how much do they know beyond that. Bible schools starting springing into existed near near 75 years ago in a response partly due to the lack of biblical knowledge that was being passed on. People did not know their Bibles near enough as they should. This was a problem, and even today, it remains a problem. As Bible schools transition into more secular settings, and courses on practice, instead of content, continue to be on the rise, we face a similar situation, people are not being educated about the Word of God. It is difficult to give someone a Bible college education from the pulpit. It is near impossible to make disciples by speaking to them once a week.

I want disciples made, and I believe that comes with more chances to teach, more opportunities to expound the Word. So if the community of believers were to meet three times a week, Sunday, Friday, and Wednesday, I think it would be beneficial for the life of the Church. These need not be long sessions, but may they be meaningful.

#Biblical Theology
Foundation: 2 Timothy 2:18, 2 Timothy 4:3-4, 1 Timothy 4:1, Acts 4:12, 2 Corinthians 11:14-15, Matthew 4:1-10, Isaiah 30:8-17

Needless to say, when the Word of God is manipulated, sin happens. Sin is repulsive to God, and so tampering with the Word of God is repulsive to God. How dare we think we can add or take away from the Word of our God?
