#Smaller Congregations
Foundation: 1 Cor 11:33, 12:26, Hebrews 3:13, 10:24,

This allows for a stronger community experience, as opposed to a show mentality. Smaller congregations are more able to use their spiritual gifts in a corporate setting, instead of having 20% of the people do 80% of the work. To define small: I would say no more then 120 people. Church's when the reach this size should seek to expand, and plant a church in another strategic location.

#Rock Star Church
Foundation: 1 Corinthians 3, 1 Corinthians 12, Ephesians 4, Matthew 23:7-9, 1 Corinthians 2:6, 1 Thessalonians 5:9

We spent far too much time focused on the "rock stars" of the church. From John Piper to Mark Driscoll, we know these names too much. We have equated a certain church with its leader, and we have destroyed part of our community in the process. When a certain church becomes unanimous with its leader, the leader must continue to preach most of the sermons, give most of the talks, and provide most of the direction. Nothing short of a CEO. However, this is the the intended model for the church. The idea of the church is people from every background coming together, meeting together, sharing together, helping each other, because of the power name of Jesus Christ. It is not a show, it is not a publicity stunt. It is the gathering of the people of God. No man must become the face of such a gathering. This will prove to be a struggle, for Rock Star Church's make more money, have more followers, and have larger buildings. In the worlds eyes they are doing better then those church's that emphasize the community of God. However, our standard is not set in success according the world's standards, but rather according the standards of Christ.

This is not to say I am against multiple church's coming together, worshiping, and listening to someone expound the word of God. But let us call it for what it is. Let us call small groups church's, make them larger, and have them meet together less frequently (say, once a month).

The other downside to having a rock-star church is the limited amount of disciple making. If one many does all the preaching, when a successor is needed, often that man must come from outside the congregation. This bothers me, as I know there is more then 1 man with the gift of teaching in any congregation. What it means for those men is that they are not capable of exercising their giftings, because there is no opportunity for them to do so. That may be called quenching the Spirit in some circles.

#Building
Foundation: Acts 2:42-47

The church building should reflect the nature of people coming together. A congregation with pews all facing the front makes the church feel like a show, instead of the gathering of people that it is. The church structure should reflect the values of said church.

That said, a church must be able to operate without the need of a building. In this day we do not fear publicly telling the world that we are Christ-followers. However, there may come a day in the near future (in north america) in which the church, if it truly seeks to follow God whole-heartily, will need to move underground. We must design church's with the capability to go underground at a moments notice. If for the time, we can walk in the sunshine, let us do so, but let us not be afraid of the dark either, for our Lord and Savior is mightier then both.

So how does a church gain the ability to go underground at a moments notice? A gathering of people must not restrict themselves to any one location. With the renting of buildings it made a lot of sense to build a church dedicated to the specific purpose of having people gather there. It would save on cost, and the church could be customized to meet the needs of the people who came.

The church must be able to complete these tasks:
Teaching (especially for new converts) [a must for discipleship]
Gathering
Communion/Fellowship
Baptism
Ministry
Funerals
Weddings
Baby Dedications

All of these activities do not require a single location. The "modern" church needs a location, as sound-systems must be set up, projectors must display information, guitars and sound boards need to be properly tuned. All of which require time and location. However, the church must focus instead on what is important. Sound systems are not important to the Gospel. Sure, they help to have a larger congregation, but is that larger congregation simply turning into a show?

Until the rise of Christendom in 313, most church's were smaller sites, meeting in larger homes, and coming together to worship as a church of a certain city. It was Constantine who brought in the era of "church" buildings in order to promote the new religion. While the pros and cons of having a state religion may be debated, it is sufficient to say this was not the original intention of the church.

While the church must be fully autonomous, this does not mean the church cannot meet in other venues. Because Nebcom exists to provide a framework in which Planet Church, Planet Home, and Planet School can all collaborate, Planet School can and will provide free renting of the building over the weekend. The school is constructed with many classrooms...


Some Cautions against having a church building:
too much emphasis on looks (carpets, colours, class)
Clergy have offices where people must go to (come to the church, as opposed to meeting people in their homes)
Idea that church offers something not found else-where
More maintenance costs (upkeep of the church, building costs, temptation to spend money on expensive sound equipment)
Temptation to make a bigger Church (and combined with a show, this means clergy will most likely be hired from without, as there is a certain standard to be met)
Temptation to run church like a business (because it is now an organization with a building)
People come in for service, not to be served (It is all about running a good show, and the idea that evangelism should happen in the church doors)
Elders required to marry practising homosexuals (as the church becomes a function in the World, and not a counter-cultural gathering of people)
Eventually leads to where we are today
One possible reason for the Reformation (it was all about building a new church building that the Indulgences were being sold)

#Help for the poor
Foundation: James 1:27

Planet Church must make a focus on helping the poor in the area. This is central to the Gospel. Not to continue the cycle of poverty, but making an effort to help those in need to raise them up to be able to provide for themselves (in applicable cases). When a church stops caring for the poor around them, they stop showing the love of Christ

Accountability and Discipleship (C.3.5)
Foundation: Iron Sharpens Iron, Community

A strong community must be more then people simply meeting together, but must reflect people building into one another. To this end: it is the goal of Planet Church to connect every single individual in some way to another. This is not an hierarchy of submission, but rather a community of friends who speak into each others lives. Some friends have more experience then others, and have much more to give, but it helpful to remember that our desire is to make disciples of Christ, and Christ alone, not of each other.

Practically: this means that every member of Planet Church meets 1:1 with another member from Planet Church at least once a week. This person does not need to attend a particular gathering, but does need to belong to the Church.
