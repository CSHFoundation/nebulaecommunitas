\begin_layout Section
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The church is a community for a group of believers who live in close proximity
 to each other.
 The ultimate goal of the church is provide the framework necessary for
 meaningful discipleship to take place.
 The church collectively seeks to grow individuals spiritually though a
 connection to God (the Word being a key component), provide emotional/mental
 help to those who need it, and physical help to those who need it as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Church is the representation of Christ on earth.
 While the church has often gone astray from her Lord and Maker, she nevertheles
s remains loved by God.
 We hold a commitment to the church, but it is even more then that, for
 we are the church.
 We hold a commitment to ourselves to be in community with other believers.
 We believe in being in community with other believers, and we make it our
 focus to continue that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all of our efforts for spiritual growth, the church must be involved.
 We cannot raise up students who love God, if they have no learned to love
 God, if they have not learned to love the Bride of Christ.
 We cannot raise up good kids in our homes, if they have not learned to
 love God with all of their heart.
 We may discipline them, but if they do not have Christ, we have given them
 nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everything hangs on the church, for it is responsible for keeping the faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Rock of the Church is her husband, Christ Jesus our Lord.
 As such,

Roles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Apostles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apostles serve to establish new churches, but going out and proclaiming
 the truth where no one has yet heard the Gospel.
 An Apostle views these new churches as new-born children, continuing to
 care for them until they reach a maturity in the faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prophets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prophets serve to reveal the thoughts of God to the church.
 Their words must be tested by other prophets, as a safe-guard against heresy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Evangelists
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evangelists serve to bring the Gospel to people in the same location as
 their church.
 Once a person has committed their life to the Lord, the evangelist can
 provide the necessary connection to an church to help this new believer
 continue to grow as a Christian.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Elders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elders serve to guide and protect the people who belong to the church.
 As this is a role which has much influence over others, strict guidelines,
 as outlined in the NT, must be followed without compromise (1 Tim 3, Titus
 1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Teachers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Teachers serve to accurately teach the Word of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Deacons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deacons serve to serve, helping the church practically so that others can
 focus on their ministries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Priests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone is considered a priest, and as such, have access to God.
 No one has exclusive access to God, and cannot specific y how another comes
 to God.
 Also, each individual has something to contribute to the body of Christ.
 (1 Peter 2:9, 1 Cor 12:12)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Meetings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Core Groups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The church meets together in core groups regularly to disciple each other.
 These groups ideally range from 3 to 12 people.
 Meeting informally, for the purpose of discipleship, fellowship, and life.
 Core Groups meet frequently during the week, and thus are best constructed
 with local people.
 Communion is celebrated in this group, as they meet over meals, sing songs,
 and discuss their day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Mantle Groups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The church meets together in mantle groups regularly to encourage each other.
 These groups consist of no more then 72 people, consisting of 6 or more
 core groups, composed of elders, teachers, prophets, encourager's, songs,
 etc.
 (1 Cor 11:33, 12:26, Hebrews 3:13, 10:24, 25).
 It is in this group that communion, baptism, encouragement, teaching, prophecie
s, and praying happens.
 Mantle Groups meet at a minimum once a week, immediately following the
 crust group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Crust Group
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The church meets together in crust groups to keep the unity of the church.
 This group consists of up to 12 groups of 72 people (864).
 It is in this group that singing corporately happens, teaching from the
 various teachers dispersed throughout the mantle groups, prophecies, and
 missions/ministry focus.
 Crust groups meet at a minimum once a month.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Global Groups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a year the church meets, gathering the believers from the surrounding
 city, nation, and world, to encourage each other, bring others up to date
 about what is happening, break bread, and worship together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Serving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ministries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The church participates in various ministries, from serving the church,
 to serving the community, being equipped by the APEET; doing the work laid
 out before them.
 (Ephesians 2:10, 4:11-12, 1 Corinthians 12:27-31, 1 Peter 4:10).
 Ministries range across all groups, allowing those called to participate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Missions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The church also sends out apostles to create new assemblies in other locations.
 Also giving help to other assemblies that may be struggling.
 (Romans 10:15, 1 Corinthians 16:1-4, John 17:20-23, Proverbs 27:10).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Procedures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Called to Ministry, Missions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who feel called, or others see as serving in a certain role, will
 be first mentioned in the core groups.
 Once the core group affirms the direction informally, it is brought to
 the Mantle group, which votes unanimously on the person in the new role.
 If someone does not vote yes, it is then an opportunity to provide constructive
 criticism on where they could serve, or steps needed before they can serve.
 Once this decision has been made, the person is commissioned at the crust
 group, having hands laid upon them by the elders, and then prayed for by
 the entire assembly.
 All members in ministry are considered deacons, all members in missions
 are considered apostles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Updates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For those serving in various capacities, a monthly report must be given,
 and if not in person, read to the entire crust assembly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stepping down
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the a member serving feels this is no longer a direction for them, they
 will mention this in their monthly report.
 At this point, the congregation will pray for someone to rise up to fill
 their place.
 This replacing will follow the normal procedure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The church must be called to divide at a certain point, to maintain the
 internal integrity.
 If a core group reaches 16, two groups of 8 will be formed (keep families
 together).
 If a mantle group reaches 80, the group will divide, having half of the
 core groups forming a new church, and the other half starting a new church.
 In all cases, one must see the transition as a new starting, and not a
 departing from the center group.
 If a mantle crust group reaches 880, they group is split into two group
 once again.
 If facilities can no longer house the Global group, multiple global groups
 will be started.
 It is assumed that a crust group will all attend the same global group
 (if they go).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are guidelines, the numbers are less important.
 What is important is multiplication of believers, while avoiding a group
 that no longer can minister to its members.
 There is no provision for charismatic leaders who desire to have a large
 small group, they must divide, and train new leaders to be put in place.
 The church is 
\series bold
never
\series default
 a one man show, unless that man be Christ dying on the Cross.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Teaching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Depending on the differing gifts enabled, so must the gifts be used.
 If there be more then one teacher, then they must teach.
 In Crust Groups, there must be a rotation of speakers, teaching topically
 or energetically as needed.
 (1 Corinthians 14:26-33, Ephesians 4:1-16, Ecclesiastes 4:13-16, Proverbs
 24:6).
 In the crust groups, teachers teach from their seat (located as part of
 the great circle), and while he speaks, others listen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bible Reading
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the start of each and any meeting, a passage of Scripture is read aloud.
 Core Groups systematically work their way through different books of the
 Bible, so that no portion of Scripture is neglected
